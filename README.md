# Brick-Stacker
## About
Fast Light-Weight workshop for [Brick-Hill](https://www.brick-hill.com) written in C++, using OpenGL.

## How to build
Brick-Stacker uses [Premake 5.0](https://premake.github.io) to allow easy project generation across all platforms.
For more info on building with Premake use this [link](https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake)
### Windows
You can go to `./scripts` and run `build_windows.bat`, it will generate solution files for Visual Studio 2022.\n
You can edit the bat file to generate code for different Visual Studio version following this [tutorial](https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake).
### MacOS
Fuck Mac.
### Linux
Right now, there is no automatic solution, so you will have to build it youself.
[Download](https://premake.github.io/download) Premake and then, using downloaded binary, build it.
You are using Linux, so should be able to figure it out yourself.
